## Day 11: Error Handling & Loading States

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours
**Actual Time:** N/A

### Tasks

- [ ] Add error boundary components
- [ ] Implement toast notification system
- [ ] Create loading skeletons for async operations
- [ ] Add comprehensive error messages for all failure modes
- [ ] Implement retry logic for network failures
- [ ] Add error logging to Sentry (optional)

### Claude Code Creates

- [ ] `/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (React error boundary)
- [ ] `/components/Toast.tsx` (notification system)
- [ ] `/components/LoadingSkeleton.tsx` (loading states)
- [ ] `/lib/error-handler.ts` (centralized error handling)

  - Disconnect internet during message send
  - Exceed quota
  - Invalid API key
  - Database connection failure
- [ ] Verify friendly error messages appear
- [ ] Check loading states show during async operations
- [ ] Test retry logic works

### Verification

**Error Handling:**
- [ ] API failures → User-friendly message (not technical stack trace)
- [ ] Network issues → "Connection lost. Retrying..." with countdown
- [ ] Quota exceeded → "Upgrade to continue" with clear CTA
- [ ] Rate limiting → "Too many requests. Wait X seconds."
- [ ] Authentication errors → Redirect to login with message
- [ ] 404s → Custom 404 page with navigation

**Loading States:**
- [ ] Message sending → Spinner in chat input
- [ ] Conversation loading → Skeleton messages
- [ ] Persona switching → Skeleton messages + disabled input
- [ ] Admin panel loading → Table skeletons

- [ ] Error: "Failed to send message. Retry?" (manual dismiss)
- [ ] Info: "Conversation saved" (auto-dismiss in 2s)
- [ ] Warning: "Approaching quota limit" (manual dismiss)

**Error Recovery:**
- [ ] Network failure → Auto-retry 3 times with exponential backoff
- [ ] API timeout → Show retry button
- [ ] Partial failures → Save what succeeded, highlight what failed
- [ ] No uncaught errors in browser console

### Error Scenarios Checklist

Test these specific scenarios:
- [ ] Send message while offline
- [ ] Claude API returns 500 error
- [ ] Database query times out
- [ ] User logs out mid-conversation
